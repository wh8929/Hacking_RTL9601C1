# Hacking RTL9601C1
Hacking V2801F & TWCGPON657 to suite your ISP Fiber

# Issue
GPON market is a mess, plus explicit OMCI cause ONU Stick did not work

With my issue:
* V2801F build quality is bad, died from overheating, firmware is good, manage to have an internet connection
* TWCGPON657 build quality is good, firmware is bad, CPU usage become 100% when PLOAM Password is set

Since we dont have source code, try mix and match binary between V2801F and TWCGPON657

# Auto Reboot Fix
## V2801F
### Issue
* Invalid `VS_AUTH_KEY`
* Changing MAC Address `ELAN_MAC_ADDR` can cause wrong `VS_AUTH_KEY` value

### Fix
* You need to generate new `VS_AUTH_KEY` when change `ELAN_MAC_ADDR`
* Apperently, you have few seconds to access Telnet before rebooting
* To prevent auto reboot by entering `echo 3 > /proc/fiber_mode` (XPON Ethernet Mode)

> If you can't type fast enough, use this autoit script `quick_telnet-login.au3`.
>
> Take a look some generated [`VS_AUTH_KEY` here](Docs/VS_AUTH_KEY.md)

### Note
When `echo 3 > /proc/fiber_mode` is set, you lose telnet acccess, you need to unplug fiber to get back

## TWCGPON657
* No such problem, `VS_AUTH_KEY` does not exist.

# Usage
* Please read [FLASH_GETSET_INFO.md](Docs/FLASH_GETSET_INFO.md) for how to configure, login, etc...
* Advance setting like duplicate ONT Info, read [FLASH_GETSET_DEV.md](Docs/FLASH_GETSET_DEV.md)

# Modify
You need a Linux PC/VM, Ubuntu as Operating System

## Prerequisite
You need these program installed:
* `tar` (extract tar package)
* `squashfs-tools` (extract/repack rootfs)
* `qemu-user-static` (run MIPS VM)

## Extract firmware
* Extract Firmware package in `tar` format, we need `rootfs` file
* Extract `rootfs` partition
```
unsquashfs rootfs
```

## Repack firmware
* Repack `rootfs`
```
mksquashfs squashfs-root rootfs.new -b 131072 -comp lzma
```
* Rename `rootfs`
```
mv rootfs rootfs.old
mv rootfs.new rootfs
```
* Update `md5sum`
```
md5sum fwu.sh rootfs uImage fwu_ver > md5.txt
```
* tar current folder
```
tar -cvf ../firmware.tar *
```
